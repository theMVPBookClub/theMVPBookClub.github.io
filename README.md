## Welcome to theMVPBookClub

This is a placeholder site for the yet to be released community project called theMVPBookClub

### What is theMVPBookClub

theMVPBookClub is a place where Microsoft MVP's (current and previous) can come and provide colletive reviews on books that we may have read, whether technical or non technical, or fiction or non-fiction as a way to help encourage many of us to take some time away from the screen.
